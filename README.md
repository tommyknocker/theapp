## TheApp.pro 
**Tiny, fast and powerful microframework.**

The App is in active development state. Complete documentation will be available soon.

### Key features:

* Unique chainable App factory. You can chain every class withot even modifying it as easy as:  ```App::SomeClass($initParams)->method($someParams)->method2('result')->sw('OtherClass')->method3()->result```
* Event-based routing. Include custom http (ex. PUT, DELETE, PATCH) methods.
* Built-in I18n support with plural rules for all languages (inspired by mozzilla plural rules - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_and_Plurals).
* Composer support. Expand framework in the way you want to.
